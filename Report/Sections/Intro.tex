\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}

This report is the result of our Master's Thesis at the IT-University of Copenhagen, spring 2015.

The goal of the thesis was to apply both constrained novelty search and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to do online procedural content generation (PCG) of maps for Starcraft, analyze the quality of the generated maps and compare the trade-offs required in order for each algorithms to generate maps fast enough to b e used in online PCG.

\textbf{NOTE:} The order is totally fucked. I have just been writing whatever came to mind.

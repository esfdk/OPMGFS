\section{Decisions about map generation}
\label{DecisionsMapGeneration}

As the main focus of our thesis was on generating balanced maps, we spent a lot of time on figuring out how, exactly, we wanted to go about generating the maps. We had decided on using Constrained Novelty Search and Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms, but no other specifics than that.

We discussed having each algorithm generate everything (heightmap and features) but we had concerns about the runtime of the algorithms if they had to constantly change the terrain, especially on larger maps.

In order to cut down on the time spent changing the terrain, we chose to generate the base heightmap initially and then let the two algorithms take care of placing various features on the map, and in some cases make minor changes to the terrain. 

We considered a number of possible options for generating the terrain (fractals, agents and noise), but in the end we decided to use cellular automatas. A Starcraft map is, as mentioned in section \ref{MapRepresentation}, represented as a grid which is exactly what most cellular automatas work with. Furthermore, the rules - and therefore results - of cellular automatas are easy to change which allowed us to try a lot of different settings in little time in order to figure out what rules we needed.

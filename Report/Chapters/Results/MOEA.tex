\section{Multi-objective Evolution}
\label{results_moea}

Three tests were performed on the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II). These tests are similar to the ones performed on the standard genetic algorithm.

\begin{my_itemize}

	\item NSGA-II with a random initial population. The settings used for this test are the same as the ones used for the standard genetic algorithm (see table \ref{tab:results_evolution_combinations}). The results are shown in table \ref{tab:results_moea_results}.

	\item NSGA-II with an initial population made from the highest novelty maps created by constrained novelty search. This test uses the same settings combinations as the same test for the standard genetic algorithm. The settings and results are shown in table \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighfitness}.

	\item NSGA-II with an initial population made from the highest fitness maps created by constrained novelty search. This test uses the same settings combinations as the same test for the standard genetic algorithm. The settings and results are shown in table \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighnovelty}.

\end{my_itemize}

Like the results in the novelty search section, all numbers are the average of running the algorithm with settings on ten different base maps. One thing to note about the results is that the average fitness is very low in most cases. This happens because NSGA-II generates a new set of offspring during the last generation, and some of the offsprings risk mutating in such a way that they may not be able to place start bases. This results in a very low fitness value, which impacts the average fitness significantly. The average fitness is therefore not as telling for the NSGA-II algorithm as for the standard genetic algorithm. Due to the risk of such a low fitness, \textit{convergence} is based on when the maximum fitness did not change for three generations. It does not take minimum fitness into consideration.

From the results shown in table \ref{tab:results_moea_results}, it is clear that a low population leads to worse overall maps. Settings $A$, $C$ and $H$ all have a population of 5 and their maximum fitness are all lower than 42. $B$ has a slightly larger population but a small number of generations (15 of each) and also has a low fitness score. A low population means that the evolution is more likely to get stuck in a local optima, due to much less variance introduced in the population due to very few offspring being created.

A good spot seems to be around 10 generations and a population of 25 or the other way around. $D$ and $E$ have these settings and are similar in terms of results. $E$ results in slightly better overall maps, though the search is slightly slower. Compared to the best set, $F$ (30 generations, population of 25), $D$ and $E$ do not perform quite as well (being $1.19$ and $0.44$ behind in fitness respectively), but they are both at least twice as fast. This suggests that an increase in either generations or population above the 10/25 combination provides very little benefit compared to how much longer the search takes. This holds true for set $I$ too.

While the sets of settings do have an influence on how much time it takes to find maps of high quality, it is important to note that - like with novelty search - the base map has a lot of influence on how the search turns out. Looking at the raw data collected, the highest and lowest fitness maps generated with settings $F$ are $47.75$ and $38.69$, respectively. This difference is quite significant, which means that some base maps may simply not have the potential for a high-quality map.

Comparing the  NSGA-II algorithm's results to those of the standard genetic algorithm, NSGA-II does not score much better than the standard genetic algorithm. For the settings $G$, $H$ and $I$, the standard genetic algorithm actually scores slightly better than the NSGA-II algorithm. The differences in the scores for all the test setups are so small that it could be due to variance, however.

Seeding NSGA-II with maps found through constrained novelty search results in higher quality maps in the end, at the cost of total run time. The time spent running the NSGA-II algorithm does not change with a different seeding, but running constrained novelty search adds extra time that has to be factored in. Set $F$ (the best with random seeding) improves by 1.08 when seeding with the most novel maps found and improves by 2.36 when seeding with the highest fitness maps found. The cost is the novelty search that takes 177 seconds extra, basically doubling the total time the search takes. These results (along with the rest in table \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighfitness} and \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighnovelty}) show that seeding with maps from novelty search makes the NSGA-II search produce higher quality maps, even in the poor cases of normal NSGA-II ($H$).

Both versions of seeding take roughly the same amount of time, however, as they both run constrained novelty search the same way. The difference in time shown in the tables is most likely just variance. The only difference is how maps are selected from the results of the novelty search and that difference is minuscule compared to the actual search times. Table \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighfitness} and \ref{tab:results_novelmoeahighnovelty} clearly show that seeding the NSGA-II algorithm with highest fitness individuals results in a higher quality of the final maps than seeding with highest novelty individuals.

Compared to the standard genetic algorithm, seeding NSGA-II with highest fitness individuals result in very similar scores (with a variance of +/- 1.5). When seeding with highest novelty individuals, NSGA-II pulls slightly ahead of the standard genetic algorithm, but seeding with highest novelty individuals does not score better than with highest fitness individuals, as mentioned above.

\subsection*{Novelty of MOEA Maps}

High fitness is important, but it is also important that different settings generate different maps. If they do not, the only point in different settings is how much time a search takes.

Figure \ref{fig:results_moea_samebasediffsettings} shows the novelty of the maps generated by using settings $E$ and $H$ on the same base map. As can be seen, they are very different in where they have focused their efforts, with $E$ managing to create maps that differs in more areas than $H$, where $H$ has focused more on the same areas. This can be attributed to the small population size as it is difficult to get out of a local optima with a small population size.

As a search on one base map creates different maps, it is fair to assume that searching on different base maps will create very different maps. Figure \ref{fig:results_moea_bestmapsdiffsettings} shows this assumption to be true. The two novelty maps shown have been generated from searching with two different sets of settings ($E$ and $H$) on the same base maps and taking the best map for each of those base maps. It is clear that the best maps created are very different from each other, as there are only few dark areas. The two maps show that the search settings have some things in common (the dark areas along the edge of the map). This is to be expected, as base maps have an influence on the final maps.

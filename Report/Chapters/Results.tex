There are many different options in the search-based map generation approach presented in this thesis. In most cases, these options have an influence on the results generated by the search and/or the runtime of the search. The goal of this thesis is to compare different search methods, so the testing was focused on changing settings that affect the search algorithms instead of the settings that control aspects of the map.

This means that some settings have not been changed during testing. One of them is the fitness calculation settings. They determine how valuable different parts of the fitness function is and changing them between tests would make it really difficult to compare methods. The default values mean that the highest possible fitness, theoretically, is 67. It is very unlikely to be reached, as some parts of the fitness may conflict with each other. The lowest possible fitness score for a map with starting bases is -44.66, and -737 if there are no start bases in a map\footnote{No start bases means that a map literally is unplayable and thus should never be presented as the final result.}.

The cellular automata has a number of settings (e.g. generations, rule sets, map size), which have been kept the same for all tests. The map size is a static 128x128, which is common for smaller two-player maps in StarCraft II. In all tests, the cellular automata ruleset is a basic set of rules that focuses on generating roughly an even amount of each height levels in reasonably sized clusters. The map search options have also been kept the same for all the tests. These options control how many of the different items a map should be able to contain, what the chance of adding or removing an item is and in which area of the map items should be placeable. This means that one half of a map can contain a maximum of one start base, five expansion bases, 18 ramps, eight sets of destructible rocks, and one Xel'Naga tower.

\section{Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm}
\label{methodology_moea}
While the standard genetic algorithm seeks to optimize a single objective function, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms bases its fitness on two or more fitness functions. This is because it is infeasible, for some problems, to combine all interesting features into a single fitness function. An example of this is the basic need for food and water for humans. Most fitness functions would reduce the problem to \textit{amount of food} + {amount of water}. This is infeasible, however, as humans cannot function without water and/or food. Therefore for any solution to be feasible, it is necessary for it to provide both enough food and water for a human to survive. During the evolution process, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms focuses on finding solutions that are 
\textit{non-dominated solutions} (a solution is dominated when there is at least one other solution "that is better in at least one objective and worse in none."\cite{togelius2013controllable}). In the case of food and water for a human, for any solution to dominate another, it must provide at least as much food and water as the solution it dominates, and must provide more of either food or water.

Using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is a solid approach to StarCraft map generation, as there are multiple objectives to optimize when generating a good map, such as distance between starting bases, number of choke points, how easily it is to defend a starting position, and the number of expansions available to players.

\section{Initialising Evolution With Novel Individuals}
\label{methodology_evolutionnovelseeds}
Search algorithms often have an initial population that is randomly initialised in order to ensure diversity in the search. This diversity in the search could also be provided by seeding an evolutionary algorithm with novel solutions found using novelty search. In addition to testing evolution and novelty search separately, two different tests will be performed to test the combination of the two paradigms for improvements in the trade-off between speed, novelty, and quality of the generated maps. The first test will be to seed evolutionary algorithms with the most novel of the solutions found with novelty search, while the second test will seed the evolutionary algorithms with the solutions from the novel archive that have the most fitness.

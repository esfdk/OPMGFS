\subsection{Optimal Trade-off}
% discuss tradeoff and which method offers the best balance/speed ratio
% discuss close alternatives

\subsection{Suggested Method}
There is no singular optimal method for generating maps for all types of StarCraft players. 

\subsubsection{Player Archetypes}
Below three archetypes are defined as guideline in order to provide a context for the suggestions. Players can be more than one archetype at a time, but they will likely tend towards one more than the others.

\paragraph{The Competitor:} Players who either compete at the highest level (both in tournaments and on the ladder) or aspire to do so rely on studying a map beforehand and practising different strategies in order to squeeze out the best possible performance. These players value balance and fairness above interestingness, novelty, and generation speed. It is likely that these players will spend far longer practising a single strategy on a generated map than the generator will take to create it.

\paragraph{The Hardcore Non-Competitor:} Players who play a lot of StarCraft (and games in general), but does so with a non-competitive approach and mindset. While high levels of balance and fairness is welcome for these players, they put much value on an interesting and novel experience when playing the game. As such, the hardcore non-competitor will value interestingness/novelty above balance/fairness. It is likely, however, that generated maps will be discarded more quickly by this type of player as they seek the next novel experience. This means that map generation speed will be very important for the hardcore non-competitor.

\paragraph{The Casual:} Players who want to have a few matches every couple of days. While the casual player is not as focused on perfect balance, they still want to experience matches that are challenging, but not impossible. Because they do not dedicate a lot of time to play, the casual player will likely value map generation speed highly in order to play more matches in their limited time. The casual player values balance/fairness and interestingness/novelty equally, but prioritises map generation speed.

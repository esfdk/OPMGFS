\\Online Procedural Content Generation of Starcraft Maps\end{center}
This paper describes a method for generating map layouts that can be used to create StarCraft II maps. A cellular automata generates base maps that are explored using search-based approaches. In order to explore the trade-off between generation speed and map quality, three approaches are implemented. Constrained novelty search, a standard genetic algorithm, and a multi-objective algorithm are compared and evaluated based on the time it takes to perform searches, the difference between the maps that each method generates, and the quality of the generated maps. The quality is determined using a fitness function focused on optimising balance between playable races and viable strategies. With some improvements, the method could be used for both online and offline StarCraft II map generation.

TODO:
	Grooss
		Better Smoothing
		Cellular Automata after placing map points
		Upper limit on pathfinding
		Expand choke point search
		
	Melnyk
		Displacement
		Random add/remove of map elements
		Destructible rocks in seperate array
	
	TBA
		Figure out how to remove "bad starting maps" by preprocess prior to starting evolution/novelty search
		Jump Point Search
		Consider both direct (flight) and ground path between points in fitness function
		Figure out cost and/or how to consider siege tank ranges
		Figure out cost and/or how to consider "openness" of bases / impassable terrain around a base
		Number of choke points seen by Xel'Naga towers
	
Notes:
	Quality = Novelty of map + mechanical quality
	Test parameters by generating the exact same maps (through fixed seed), but with different evaluation parameters
	Preprocess bad start maps
	Use an upper limit on path length (if path is too long, stop pathfinding)
	Calculate both ground and flight distances (consider blink/reaper pathing? Probably too expensive)
	Good Maps: Foxtrot Labs, Xel'Naga Caverns, Waystation
	
	
	
Old Notes:
	1-1 representation
	Radial
		center of radial is center of entire map
		place elements in one half
		mirror/turn map
		pathfinding between bases before/after
		turtle graphics for impassable terrain (scrapped for now)
		initial height map using cellular automata

		Figure out best values for ground map distances and other fitness values
	
	Low prio TODOs
		Number of choke points seen by Xel'Naga towers
		Implement offspring boost (as option?)
		Implement FI2NS
		Figure out cost and/or how to consider siege tank ranges
		Impassable terrain around edge of map (possibly in base map generation)
		Figure out how to remove "bad starting maps" by preprocess prior to starting evolution/novelty search
		
	Finished TODOs
		(done) Cellular Automata after placing map points
		(done) Expand choke point search

		(done) Distance to ALL expansions considered
		(done) Consider both direct (flight) and ground path between points in fitness function
		(done) Fix bug in choke point search
		(ground/flight done) Calculate both ground and flight distances
		(done) Impement other version of ramp placement
		(check if fixed)Base openess (combine number of traversable points around occupied area & 8 directions from center of base (8 directions only from start)
		
Notes:
	Quality = Novelty of map + mechanical quality
	Test parameters by generating the exact same maps (through fixed seed), but with different evaluation parameters
	Preprocess bad start maps
	Use an upper limit on path length (if path is too long, stop pathfinding)
	Good Maps: Foxtrot Labs, Xel'Naga Caverns, Waystation
	Openness of Bases is largest fault with fitness algorithm
	Post-smoothing is rather slow, so less pretty maps vs speed tradeoff
	We do not consider blink/reaper movement in fitness calculation
	Novelty search: one parent - one child
	2 tile wide cliffs cover more area than otherwise
	Start Base Approach openess is VERY naive
	When we in code use "max" in fitness, we sometimes mean "optimal"
	Should have included novelty significance factors so that different start base positions are more significant in novelty calculations than difference in destructible rock placement

	MOEA:
		Keep selecting non-dominated solutions until only dominated solutions are left. 
		After that, we select solutions based on how many solutions that dominate them.
		If two (or more) solutions are dominated by the same number, we select the one that dominate the other.
			If they do not dominate each other, we select based on fitness.
		TL;DR: Dominance > Fitness
	
Old Notes:
	1-1 representation
	Radial
		center of radial is center of entire map
		place elements in one half
		mirror/turn map
		pathfinding between bases before/after
		turtle graphics for impassable terrain (scrapped for now)
		initial height map using cellular automata

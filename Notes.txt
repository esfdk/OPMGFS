TODO:
	Grooss
		(done) Xel naga tower in fitness
		(done) Consider destructible rocks in jump point search
		(done) Consider xel'naga towers in jps (maybe other stuff?)
		(done, we decided to go with old method) No diagonal cliffs
		(check if fixed)Base openess (combine number of traversable points around occupied area & 8 directions from center of base (8 directions only from start)
		Remove TODOs from his TODO list if the TODO is not longer TOBEDONE
		
	Melnyk
		Fix ramps
		Make fix for infinite loop in novelty search initial population
				
	Uassigned TODOs
		Time limit on evolution/novelty search (and figure out what should be limit)
		Figure out best values for ground map distances and other fitness values
	
	Low prio TODOs
		Number of choke points seen by Xel'Naga towers
		Implement offspring boost (as option?)
		Implement FI2NS
		Figure out cost and/or how to consider siege tank ranges
		Impassable terrain around edge of map (possibly in base map generation)
		Figure out how to remove "bad starting maps" by preprocess prior to starting evolution/novelty search
		
	Finished TODOs
		(done) Cellular Automata after placing map points
		(done) Expand choke point search
		(done) Jump Point Search
		(done) Displacement (done)
		(done) Random add/remove of map elements (done)
		(done) Destructible rocks in seperate array
		(done) Set up evolution for testing
		(done) Distance to ALL expansions considered
		(done) Consider both direct (flight) and ground path between points in fitness function
		(done) Fix bug in choke point search
		(ground/flight done) Calculate both ground and flight distances
		(done) Impement other version of ramp placement
		
Notes:
	Quality = Novelty of map + mechanical quality
	Test parameters by generating the exact same maps (through fixed seed), but with different evaluation parameters
	Preprocess bad start maps
	Use an upper limit on path length (if path is too long, stop pathfinding)
	Good Maps: Foxtrot Labs, Xel'Naga Caverns, Waystation
	Openness of Bases is largest fault with fitness algorithm
	Post-smoothing is rather slow, so less pretty maps vs speed tradeoff
	We do not consider blink/reaper movement in fitness calculation
	Novelty search: one parent - one child
	2 tile wide cliffs cover more area than otherwise
	Start Base Approach openess is VERY naive
	When we in code use "max" in fitness, we sometimes mean "optimal"
	
Old Notes:
	1-1 representation
	Radial
		center of radial is center of entire map
		place elements in one half
		mirror/turn map
		pathfinding between bases before/after
		turtle graphics for impassable terrain (scrapped for now)
		initial height map using cellular automata
